This is my final interactive project at the Major Studio 1 class during my study at the MS Data Visualization program at Parsons School of Design. The project is in collaboration with The Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) in the United Nations.

### Data Source

[Gender Gap in Leisure Time](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/minutes-spent-on-leisure?time=latest) based on OECD Gender Data 2020

### Repo

These are archived original vanilla Javascript files which later I converted to Svelte. For current iteration, go to [live project](https://muons.com/msdv-ms1-interactive-leisure-time/) or latest [project documentation](https://github.com/muonius/msdv-ms1-interactive-leisure-time).
