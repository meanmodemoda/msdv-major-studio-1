This mini dashboard is the first quantitative project in my Major Studio 1 class as part of the study of MS Data Visualization. It visualizes SDG progress scores at regional and global levels. I went through 3 rounds of iterations and eventually landed on small multiples with more nuanced tooltip functions for easy data comparison. The chart is entirely built with d3.js and JS/HTML>
