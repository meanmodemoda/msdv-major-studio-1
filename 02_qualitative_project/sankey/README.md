# Summary

I forwent the initial dendrogram design and tried to replicate the first concept from [Week 6's](https://github.com/muonius/msdv-major-studio-1/tree/master/week06_qualitative_sketches) design. To achieve the flow effect, I decided to experiment with Sankey diagram.

### Data Preparation

To change from dendrogram to Sankey diagram, I need to restructure the data from hierarchy data to flow data(nodes and links).
Here is the code I used to transform the data.
