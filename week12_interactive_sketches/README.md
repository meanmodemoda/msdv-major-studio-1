### Concept 1: CO2 Emissions Production vs Consumption

This visualization examines the differnces between production based emission accounting and consumption based emission accounting and highlights that high income countries, such as OECD members,have an international negative spillover effect on over-consumption and climate action, potentially through offshoring emissions to more carbon-intensive industries in other countries. Narrativity allows me to connect the nuanced dots without overwhelming users with information.

### Concept 2: Where Does The Leisure Time Go?

This visualization compares the minutes spent on leisure time and minutes spent on unpaid care work time between men and women worldwide. It is a strong indicator that women's gap in leisure time mostly goes to unpaid, under-recognized care time. It also touches upon a positive correlation between women's leisure time and government child support policies and men's participation in care work.

### Concept 3: Mind Your E-Waste, Mine Your E-Waste

This visualization is my least favorite one. It is an aggregate of infographics that emphasize on the urgent need to tackle challenges of e-waste generated in the world and also seize the opportunity to recyle resources from e-waste which are currently significantly under-managed.
